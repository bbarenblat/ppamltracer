			      ppamltracer, v0.2.0

ppamltracer is a lightweight tracing library designed for explicit
instrumentation of generated code.  If you're writing a compiler and need hard
data on your optimizer's efficacy, ppamltracer is the library for you.

ppamltracer writes trace logs in the Open Trace Format [1], a free and open
standard developed by the Zentrum f√ºr Informationsdienste und
Hochleistungsrechnen (Center for Information Services and High-Performance
Computing) at the Technical University of Dresden.

This package contains the C code required to build the libppamltracer shared
library, as well as bindings for Haskell, Racket, Python, and Java.  While the
bindings present idiomatic interfaces of various degrees of safety, they all
rely on the shared library, so you'll need to install that first.  For detailed
installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

For examples that use the C API, see the examples directory.  For examples that
use the APIs presented by the various language bindings, see the READMEs
associated with those bindings.
