			   ppamltracer-java, v0.2.0

This package contains Java bindings to ppamltracer.  They require Java SE 5 or
later.

This package uses the Java Native Interface.  Therefore, building it produces
two artifacts: a jar, which you should install in your CLASSPATH, and a shared
library, which you should install in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  If you have both
Ant and autotools installed, simply typing `ant' will build both artifacts and
install them in the `dist' directory.

For examples of use, see the examples directory.
