/**
 * A lightweight, portable tracing library for instrumenting generated code.
 *
 * <p> ppamltracer is a lightweight, portable tracing library designed for
 * explicit instrumention of generated code. If you're writing a compiler and
 * need hard data on your optimizer's efficacy, ppamltracer is the library for
 * you.  This Java package provides bindings to the libppamltracer C API.
 *
 * <p> This package's usage can be summed up in a few lines:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   // Create report.
 *   Tracer tracer = new ExplicitlyConfiguredTracer("/tmp/my_report");
 *
 *   // Register phase 1 and do stuff.
 *   Phase phase = tracer.createPhase("phase 1");
 *   phase.start();
 *   doStuff();
 *   phase.stop();
 *   phase.close();
 *
 *   // Register phase 2 and do different stuff.
 *   phase = tracer.createPhase("phase 2");
 *   // Other stuff
 *   phase.start();
 *   doOtherStuff();
 *   phase.stop();
 *   // Yet more stuff
 *   phase.start();
 *   doYetMoreStuff();
 *   phase.stop();
 *
 *   // Clean up.
 *   phase.close();
 *   tracer.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p> This creates a report with the total runtime of <code>doStuff</code>
 * recorded as "phase 1" and the total runtime of <code>doOtherStuff</code> and
 * <code>doYetMoreStuff</code> combined as "phase 2".
 *
 * <p> <code>com.galois.ppaml.tracer.examples.Simple</code>, included in the
 * distribution, contains a more lengthy example.
 *
 * <p> ppamltracer writes trace logs in the
 * <a href="http://tu-dresden.de/zih/otf/">Open Trace Format</a>, a free and
 * open standard developed by the Zentrum f√ºr Informationsdienste und
 * Hochleistungsrechnen (Center for Information Services and High-Performance
 * Computing) at the Technical University of Dresden.
 *
 * <p> We developed ppamltracer as part of DARPA's
 * <a href="http://darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Probabilistic_Programming_for_Advanced_Machine_Learning_(PPAML).aspx">Probabilistic
 * Programming for Advancing Machine Learning</a> (PPAML) project.
