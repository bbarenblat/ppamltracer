@title{ppamltracer}

ppamltracer is a lightweight, portable tracing library designed for explicit instrumention of generated code.
If you're writing a compiler and need hard data on your optimizer's efficacy, ppamltracer is the library for you.
This Racket library provides a high-level API on top of the libppamltracer C API.

ppamltracer's usage can be summed up in a couple lines:

@racketblock[
(require ppamltracer)
(let/tracer [tracer "/tmp/my_report"]
  (let/phase tracer [phase "phase 1"]
    (with-phase-running phase
      (do-stuff)))
  (let/phase tracer [phase "phase 2"]
    (with-phase-running phase
      (do-other-stuff))
    (with-phase-running phase
      (do-yet-more-stuff))))
]

This creates a report with the total runtime of @racket[do-stuff] recorded as "phase 1" and the total runtime of @racket[do-other-stuff] and @racket[do-yet-more-stuff] combined as "phase 2".

@secref{getting-started} contains a more lengthy example.

ppamltracer writes trace logs in the @hyperlink["http://tu-dresden.de/zih/otf/"]{Open Trace Format}, a free and open standard developed by the Zentrum fÃ¼r Informationsdienste und Hochleistungsrechnen (Center for Information Services and High-Performance Computing) at the Technical University of Dresden.

We developed ppamltracer as part of DARPA's @hyperlink["http://darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Probabilistic_Programming_for_Advanced_Machine_Learning_(PPAML).aspx"]{Probabilistic Programming for Advancing Machine Learning} (PPAML) project.


@section[#:tag "getting-started"]{Getting Started}

This basic example demonstrates using ppamltracer to trace two functions -- a factorial function and a Fibonacci number generator.

@#reader scribble/comment-reader (racketblock
;; simple.rkt -- basic ppamltracer example
;; This file is in the public domain.

(require racket/sequence)
(require ppamltracer)

(define (fact phase n)
  ;; Record that we're running inside the factorial phase.
  (with-phase-running phase
    ;; Compute the factorial.
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (fact phase (- n 1))))))

(define (fib phase n)
  ;; Record that we're running inside the Fibonacci phase.
  (with-phase-running phase
    ;; Compute the nth Fibonacci number.
    (case n
      [(0 1) n]
      [else (+ (fib phase (- n 1)) (fib phase (- n 2)))])))

;; Start ppamltracer.
(let/tracer [tracer "/tmp/simple_report"]
  ;; Register the factorial phase.
  (let/phase tracer [phase "fact"]
    ;; Print factorials.
    (printf "Factorials: ")
    (sequence-for-each (lambda (n) (printf "~a " (fact phase n)))
                       (in-range 40))
    (printf "\n"))
  ;; Register the Fibonacci phase.
  (let/phase tracer [phase "fib"]
    ;; Print Fibonacci numbers.
    (printf "Fibonacci numbers: ")
    (sequence-for-each (lambda (n) (printf "~a " (fib phase n)))
                       (in-range 16))
    (printf "\n")))

@section{API in Depth}

@defmodule[ppamltracer]

@subsection{Tracers}

ppamltracer is fundamentally a set of stateful operations; the @racket[tracer] data type holds the state ppamltracer needs to operate properly.

@defproc[(tracer? [obj any/c])
         boolean?]{
  Evaluates to @racket[#t] if and only if @racket[obj] is a @racket[tracer].
}

@defproc*[([(call-with-tracer [proc (-> tracer? A)])
            A]
           [(call-with-tracer [report-name-base path-string?]
                              [proc (-> tracer? A)])
            A])]{
  Creates a new @racket[tracer].
  The @racket[tracer] will save trace reports in Open Trace Format.
  Should @racket[report-name-base] be specified, all trace file paths will begin with @racket[report-name-base]; otherwise, all trace file paths will begin with the contents of the environment variable @envvar{PPAMLTRACER_TRACE_BASE}.

  Invoking @racket[call-with-tracer] without specifying @racket[report-name-base] is an error if @envvar{PPAMLTRACER_TRACE_BASE} is undefined.
  Doing so will cause Racket to throw (a sub-exception of) @racket[exn:fail:ppamltracer:configuration].
}

@defform*[#:id let/tracer
          #:literals (tracer)
          [(let/tracer [tracer] body ...)
           (let/tracer [tracer report-name-base] body ...)]
          #:contracts ([report-name-base path-string?])]{
  Macro version of @racket[call-with-tracer].
  Equivalent to one of

  @racketblock[
  (call-with-tracer (lambda (tracer) body ...))
  (call-with-tracer report-name-base (lambda (tracer) body ...))
  ]
}

@subsection{Phases}

A @racket[phase] represents a phase of execution about which the user wishes to gather timing statistics.

@defproc[(phase? [obj any/c])
         boolean?]{
  Evaluates to @racket[#t] if and only if @racket[obj] is a @racket[phase].
}

@defproc[(call-with-phase [tracer tracer?]
                          [phase-name string?]
                          [proc (-> phase? A)])
         A]{
  Creates a new @racket[phase] attached to @racket[tracer] and named @racket[phase-name].
}

@defform[#:id let/phase
         #:literals (phase)
         (let/phase tracer [phase name] body ...)
         #:contracts ([tracer tracer?]
                      [name string?])]{
  Macro version of @racket[call-with-phase].
  Equivalent to

  @racketblock[
  (call-with-phase tracer name (lambda (phase) body ...))
  ]
}

@subsection{Tracing}

@defproc[(call-with-phase-running [phase phase?]
                                  [proc (-> A)])
         A]{
  Runs @racket[proc], associating information about its timing and execution with @racket[phase] in the trace report.
  Should @racket[proc] throw an exception, @racket[call-with-phase-running] will stop tracing before propagating the exception up the stack.
}

@defform[#:id with-phase-running
         #:literals (phase)
         (with-phase-running phase body ...)
         #:contracts ([phase phase?])]{
  Macro version of @racket[call-with-phase-running].
  Equivalent to

  @racketblock[
  (call-with-phase-running phase (lambda () body ...))
  ]
}
